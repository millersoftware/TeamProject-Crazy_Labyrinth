Team project 1 for Game Design class

Purpose/Description: The goal of this game is to get a ball through a twisting maze. 
This ball is controlled by W A S D and the arrow keys. 
As you progress inward into the maze it gets harder and harder as you get closer to the big obstacle. 
The turret is in the middle of the maze and shoots out patterns of bullets that if it hits the ball it will teleport the ball back to a previous checkpoint. 
In a way you are facing a static maze with a dynamic maze at the same time. 
Another mechanic the later levels is that holes appear that also teleport the ball back to a checkpoint if hit. 
The big block the occasional shows in each level will block bullets, being a temporary shield. 
The end goal is the block at the end of the maze in the middle closest to the turret that will transition into a new level.

Score: Score is calculated based on how many seconds it takes you to complete a level. 
Each score is based on just the level, and if a new high score is reached it will display that information. 
The score is out of 500 points. 
Our game has 3 levels of progressive difficulty, with scores for each. 
The game has various menus that take you to various levels and will display various score information.
