Description: 

Welcome to our evil castle maze. The goal of this game is to get a ball through all three levels of a twisting maze. 

This player ball is controlled by W A S D or the arrow keys. As the player, you will maneuver through obstacles and 
progress through the maze to try and reach the finishline. The maze gets harder as you get closer to the center. 
Along the way are checkpoints. If you run into a bad obstacle, you will be sent back to the last checkpoint that you have 
encountered. (We are aware that we made this game difficult so we added these checkpoints instead of starting over from
the beginning.)

One of the obstacles is a turret in the middle of the maze that shoots out patterns of bullets. If a bullet hits the player ball, 
the ball will be sent back to the last checkpoint. Another mechanic in the later levels is that pressure plates(holes but pressure 
plates sounded more castle-like) appear. If you get too close to the center of the pressure plate, you will be sent back to a 
previous checkpoint. 

To help the player are the occasional big blocks that will block bullets. If the player gets behind it, it cam become a 
temporary shield. 

The end goal is the block at the end of the maze. When you reach it, a screen will appear asking if you would like to play again 
or move onto the next level. There are three addicting levels with increasing difficulty.
